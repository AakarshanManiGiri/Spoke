# Spoke

A work-in-progress spoken-word programming language built in Java to evaluate whether English-like syntax can improve developer readability, ease of use, and coding efficiency.

## Motivation

Traditional programming languages prioritize precision and performance, often at the cost of readability for beginners and non-specialists. Spoke was created to explore whether a constrained, English-like syntax can make programming constructs easier to understand without sacrificing formal structure or deterministic execution.

The goal of this project is not to replace existing languages, but to evaluate whether spoken-word-inspired syntax can improve clarity and ease of reasoning for common control-flow patterns.

## Example

```spoke
let x be number 10

loop while x less than number 100
    jump x by number 10
end loop
